# Josh Nugent

I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, studying causal inference (with [Laura Balzer](https://www.balzerlab.com/)) and cluster-randomized trials (with [Ken Kleinman](https://www.kleinman.science/)).

Before enetering the PhD program, I was a high school math teacher (and chainsaw safety enthusiast) for 8 years.

## Current projects and explainers, in no particular order
 + Power calculations for individually randomized group treatment trials
 
 + Comparing approaches to nested frailty models in survival analysis

 + [Here's](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/allFit/) a vignette on using the allFit() function to find the right algorithm for convergence in lmer/glmer.

 + [Here's](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/maximin/) a vignette explaining how maximin approaches can be used when planning a cluster randomized trial in the face of uncertainty.

 + Investigating bias in penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation for generalized linear mixed models with dichotomous outcomes (paper in process)
