# Josh Nugent

I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, studying causal inference (with [Laura Balzer](https://www.balzerlab.com/)) and cluster-randomized trials (with [Ken Kleinman](https://www.kleinman.science/)).

<br/>
Before enetering the PhD program, I was a high school math teacher and chainsaw safety enthusiast for 8 years.
<br/>
<br/>

## Current Research Projects:
 + Power calculations for individually randomized group treatment trials

 + Investigating bias in penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation for generalized linear mixed models with dichotomous outcomes (paper in process)
