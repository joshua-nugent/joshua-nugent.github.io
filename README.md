# Josh Nugent

I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, studying causal inference (with [Laura Balzer](https://www.balzerlab.com/)) and cluster-randomized trials (with [Ken Kleinman](https://www.kleinman.science/)).

Before enetering the PhD program, I was a high school math teacher (and chainsaw safety enthusiast) for 8 years.

## Current Research Projects:
Investigating bias in penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation for generalized linear mixed models with dichotomous outcomes. Paper in process.
