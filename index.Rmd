Biostatistician researching causal inference, machine learning, and cluster-randomized trials (CRTs). Before earning my doctorate (advised by [Laura Balzer](https://www.balzerlab.com/)), I was a high school math teacher for 8 years, among other things. I work frequently with the [SEARCH Collaboration](https://www.searchendaids.com/), evaluating impacts of various interventions to reduce infectious disease burden in Kenya and Uganda. Here is [my full CV](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/cv/Nugent_CV.pdf).


## Research interests & expertise:

 + Causal inference with applications to public health, medicine, and public policy
 
 + Semiparametric statistics with discrete or continuous exposures
 
 + Integrating (ensemble) machine learning and statistical inference via targeted learning
 
 + Design and analysis of CRTs, particularly with small samples
 
 + Statistical analyses with complex missingness and dependence
 
 + Interpretation and communication of statistical results
 
 + Teaching statistical concepts
 
 + Anti-racism, equity, inclusion, social justice, conflict resolution

## Informal projects, explainers, experiments, visualizations, etc...

 + Inspired by the recent arrival of a nephew, an analysis of state-level patterns in newborn names and future name popularity prediction. [Summary of some findings](http://joshua-nugent.github.io/newborn_names) and [Shiny app in development](https://joshuanugent.shinyapps.io/babynames/) to explore the data.

 + [Vignette](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/allFit/) on adjusting settings, trying different optimizers, and/or using the allFit() function to help achieve convergence in lmer/glmer mixed models. At least one person (not me) has used this to save their dissertation research from failure!

 + [Vignette](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/maximin/) walking through [Breukelen and Candel's 2015 paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280211421344) on maximin approaches to planning a cluster randomized trial and calculating sample size in the face of uncertainty.

 + Extremely beginner-friendly [vignette](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/splines/) on how splines work in regression.

 + [Forecasting flu incidence in Germany](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/eb/eb.pdf) - Seminar presentation with colleagues implementing from scratch a forecasting algorithm developed by [Brooks et al.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004382)
 
 + Unpublished paper: [Investigating bias in penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation for generalized linear mixed models with dichotomous outcomes](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/pql/main.pdf).
