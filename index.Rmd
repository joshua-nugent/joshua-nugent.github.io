Biostatistician at the [Kaiser Permanente Division of Research](https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/) focusing on causal inference, machine learning, and clustered data. Before earning my doctorate (advised by [Laura Balzer](https://www.balzerlab.com/)), I was a high school math teacher for 8 years, among other things. I have also worked frequently with the [SEARCH Collaboration](https://www.searchendaids.com/), evaluating impacts of various interventions to reduce infectious disease burden in Kenya and Uganda.

## Informal projects, explainers, experiments, visualizations, etc...

 + Inspired by the recent arrival of a nephew, an analysis of state-level patterns in newborn names and future name popularity prediction. [Summary of some 2020 findings](http://joshua-nugent.github.io/newborn_names) and [Shiny app in development](https://joshuanugent.shinyapps.io/babynames/) to explore the data.

 + [Vignette](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/allFit/) on adjusting settings, trying different optimizers, and/or using the allFit() function to help achieve convergence in lmer/glmer mixed models. At least one person (not me) has used this to save their dissertation research from failure!
