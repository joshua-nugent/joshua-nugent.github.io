### Bio & research interests


I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, researching methods for cluster randomized trials and causal inference with [Laura Balzer](https://www.balzerlab.com/) and [Ken Kleinman](https://www.kleinman.science/). Before entering the PhD program, I was a high school math teacher for 8 years, among other things. Here is [my CV](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/cv/Nugent_CV.pdf).


### Current active projects
 
 + Nonparametric causal inference methods for cluster randomized trials
 
 + Applied work with the [SEARCH Collaboration](https://www.searchendaids.com/) evaluating impacts of various interventions to reduce disease burden in Kenya and Uganda.
 
 
### Publications (primary author)

 + Nugent, J, Balzer, L. Evaluating shifts in mobility and COVID-19 case rates in U.S. counties: A demonstration of modified treatment policies for causal inference with continuous exposures. (submitted for publication, pre-print [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12529).)

 + Nugent, J, Kleinman, K. Type I error control for cluster randomized trials under varying small sample structures. BMC Med Res Methodol 21, 65 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01236-7

### Older projects, explainers, experiments with data, visualizations, etc...

 + Inspired by a new extended family member arriving soon, an analysis of state-level patterns in newborn names and future name popularity prediction. [Summary of some findings](http://joshua-nugent.github.io/newborn_names) and [Shiny app in development](https://joshuanugent.shinyapps.io/babynames/) to explore the data.

 + [Vignette](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/allFit/) on adjusting settings, trying different optimizers, and/or using the allFit() function to help achieve convergence in lmer/glmer mixed models.

 + [Vignette](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/maximin/) walking through [Breukelen and Candel's 2015 paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280211421344) on maximin approaches to planning a cluster randomized trial and calculating sample size in the face of uncertainty.

 + [Introductory vignette](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/splines/) on how splines work in regression.

 + [Forecasting flu incidence in Germany](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/eb/eb.pdf) - Seminar presentation with colleagues implementing from scratch a forecasting algorithm developed by [Brooks et al.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004382)
 
 + [COVID-19 case dashboard](https://joshuanugent.shinyapps.io/seventyfive/) developed for the Amherst-Pelham Education Association.

 + Unpublished paper: [Investigating bias in penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation for generalized linear mixed models with dichotomous outcomes](https://joshua-nugent.github.io/pql/main.pdf).
